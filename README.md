The 'free view' and the 'snake view' are able to be controlled via camera mode.

In camera mode you can rotate the camera using the arrows - up, down, right, and left.

You can also translate the camera using 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D', 'E', 'Q' - forwards, backwards, right, left, up, and down repectively.

Under the sea, during the level, you can notice some living creatures.
